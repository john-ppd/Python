#We don't need to use a variable type and the variable will support all types, float, double, and other.

x = 50

x += 5

#modulus operator, will work the same and display remained after integer division, works with decimals too
x = 5.5%2
print(x)

#printing out numbers and string same line need a wrap on the numbers, print(str(numbers)) makes the numbers into string type
numbers = 123
string = "hi there"
print(str(numbers) + string)

#ABSOLUTE VALUE
my_num = -5
print(abs(my_num))

#raised to the power of (pow(variable, power_as_int)), works with negatives
